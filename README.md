# Wine-Analysis-with-R
Analyze white wine data to see if taster scores can be predicted
This was my 4th project for Udacity where I analyzed a dataset of white wines that includes all of their chemical properties as well as their taster scores.
This project included the following:
1. cleaning the data
2. transforming the data
3. running correlation tests
4. designing linear/quadratic regressions
5. creating decision trees
6. using GGplot to create visuals.
